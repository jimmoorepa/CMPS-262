# Personal Website

## What is the purpose:
  The purpose of my e-portfolio is to showcase my interests, a 
  snapshot of me, an image gallery of my work, and my current resume.

## Development Platform:
  This website was originally developed using NotePad++, but due to some 
  limitations was later developed using Atom. The website is hosted on 
  Point Park University's IT webserver in my jail.

## Development Languages:
  HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Node

^|Item | Issue Description | Resolution

a| 
------
Issue #1 | NYT API refine search by date. | Debugging led me to my api.js file where the if statement was built incorrectly looking at a value that was always null. I changed the if statement to !== "" instead of using the keyword null.

a| 
------
Issue #2 | Portfolio images won't expand. | Debugging led me to removing my original button, and replacing with a small javascript function that opens the images in a new window or tab.

a| 
------
Issue #3 | GitHub Branches out of sync. | Merged branches, pulled to my local branch, fixed some files that were automatically updated, added new files to push to master branch.
