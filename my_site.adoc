# Personal Website

## What is the purpose:
  The purpose of my e-portfolio is to showcase my interests, a 
  snapshot of me, an image gallery of my work, and my current resume.

## Development Platform:
  This website was originally developed using NotePad++, but due to some 
  limitations was later developed using Atom. The website is hosted on 
  Point Park University's IT webserver in my jail.

## Development Languages:
  HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Node
