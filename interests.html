						<p>
						I started working on computers with an old Texas Instrument, which
						I used to create simple loop programs. Then a few years after that
						we got my Uncle's Tandy 1000, which was a great upgrade and had a color
						monitor. I started learning QBasic, and playing games. My programs also
						became more advanced as I learned conditional statements, and more
						advanced looping techniques.
						<br>
						In tenth grade, the high school upgraded their computer system. Since my
						Dad was a teacher there, I was able to ride home with him and stay after 
						school. Staying after let me learn about fixing issues there.
						<br>
						Some where is an old newspaper clipping of me in the new computer lab.
						I also helped the teachers with things when the Network Administrator was
						not there, which earned me the title "The Wizard".

						My lack of employment has allowed me to develop another interest in
						woodworking. I gather scraps of wood from local trailer factories, that 
						would otherwise be thrown out. I use the larger scraps of wood to build
						desks, shelves, and I even built a table and four chair set for my daughter.
